# ConnectFourServer

The server was written in Java using netbeans. The program can be imported into netbeans and ran. 
The included jar file can be executed with the command "ConnectFourServer.jar". The server is set 
to listen to port 1138. It accepts 2 clients and assigns them a player number based on the order
joined. It passes the moves between the clients and also keeps track of the squares that have 
been clicked. It is also in charge of checking for the winner and informs the clients of the 
winner or if the game ends in a draw. The server must be started before the clients. Once the 
game is over, the server must be restarted to play again.
